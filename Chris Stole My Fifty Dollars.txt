So, I had this insane dream that my brother stole money from me during a semi-vacation. He stole about $50 dollars, me, Mom, and Dad were yelling at him, and as I'm going through his wallet to get my fifty back, he's yelling about the fact Wells Fargo suspended his account and he bought some $550 dollar thing for him and his buds, and I'm looking through this thing I see the $930 check in his wallet, and I yell, "what are you taking about you have plenty of money!" and I come to realize that his money had a donald duck stamp of approval on the bottom back of the dollar, meaning it was basically the disney version of monopoly money. There were more in there too. I said "Chris, why is this in here?!" And he said, "he wanted to look cool..." BY HAVING MORE MONEY?! It was about this time that I woke up, nothing remembering this instance was a dream until after my COVID test early that morning. I got negative. I think the anger pushed away the COVID.
